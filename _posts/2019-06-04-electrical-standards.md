Batteries and electrical cables in our modern world have become problematic.

# Laptops
My friend's laptop power-brick / charging-cable broke recently, and he had
a hassle trying to find a new one.
The first hurdle, is to find a power source of the correct voltage.
Too low, and the device won't turn on, and may get damaged.
Too high, and the device will *definitely* get damaged.
After that, you need to worry about the physical connector.
Replacement "generic" laptop power adapters have half a dozen or more
connectors of different sizes, shapes, and pin layouts.

# Handheld Power Tools
My weed-whacker's battery is completely different from my brother's.
The batteries for my mother's hand-drill are a different voltage,
size, and shape, than every single brand offered in the local Canadian Tire,
Lowes, and Home Hardware.
If the battery dies dies, she'll need to throw the entire drill out.

# Recycle?
You might ask, "Why is this a problem - can't we just recycle these batteries and cables
when they break?"
Yes, hypothetical person who is an amalgam of different conversations I've had
over the years, you can recycle things.
However, you forget that the Three Rs stand for Reduce, Re-use, Recycle.
A clever person would realize, that those options plus the final Rebuild,
are increasing order of cost, effort, and materials!
We all want these cool gadgets, and they do eventually break,
so the "reduce" option isn't really applicable here.
However, we still have one more option before the expense of melting these
things back down, or buying a newly-built one.
Rather, we *would* have the re-use option, if these cables and batteries
were'nt proprietary, non-standard things!

# Why Care?
Proprietary cables and batteries are at best a nuisance,
but often limit peoples's choices, and add extra garbage in landfills.
When your car needs a new battery, or your truck's starter motor fails,
you have options.
You can go to the dealer if you're still on warranty, or want to pay extra
for parts that come straight from the manufacturer.
Most people however, opt to go to a third-party repair shop, which
then uses third-party components that meet the specs.
Only the broken pieces are replaced; You don't throw away the entire vehicle!

Besides just replacement and repair of devices,
standard batteries allow more options on their use.
Swapping a dead set of batteries for a set fresh out of the recharger is one.
Another option which our modern devices do not allow, is hot-swapping
of batteries.
For those of you who've never used such a device, it would have either
a smaller internal battery just big enough to power the device while
you swap out the large primary battery,
or it would have two equally sized batteries in parallel, so that
your device can maintain operating voltage while one battery is swapped.
(The operating amperage must be at most what is given by one battery.)

# Fucking Cell-Phones
I forgot a category of examples - modern cell phones / smart phones!
Smart-phones used to take proprietary batteries, which was a hassle;
Last time I looked in The Source (formerly Radio Shack), they had about two
dozen shapes and sizes of batteries for cell phones.
Don't worry, that hassle is now gone - with their integrated,
non-removable batteries, now when your smartphone battery dies, you simply
throw the entire thing into the recycle if your city has that option.
If not, just toss it into the trash - don't worry, there's only seven billion
of us, all trashing the one planet we live on!

# We've Done It Before
We've solved these problems before.

Before the standardization of battery sizes like the D, C, AA, and AAA,
batteries came in just as many sizes as the modern non-standardized ones.
Those standard sizes have powered many different devices over the years,
such as portable music players, cameras, remote-controls for televisions
(you know, the device you watch Netflix on nowadays), and walkie-talkies.
Those batteries were so prolific and easy to use, that the wireless keyboard
I'm using to write this essay right now,
*literally has AAs inside of it, instead of a custom battery!*

Cell-phone charging cables likewise used to be a mess.
Just like laptop power-bricks and cables today, they had different voltages,
maximum amperages, and plug shapes.
New phones couldn't use old cables, and you couldn't borrow one from a friend
if it was a different brand.
A lot of these ended up in the garbage.
However, enough people in Europe got sick of this nuisance and waste,
that they started a campaign on Facebook to spread the word, and
rally people to contact their political representatives.
Because of their work, cell phones must now use standard USB cables to charge.
That is, the same type of cable, which could be used to transfer data out of devices,
and which people already had on their desks!

# It's Still Possible
I'm not an electrical engineer, but as someone who's built some hobby electrical
projects, I know a few relevant things:
1. voltage converters are readily available in many
    - input voltage ranges
    - maximum amperages
    - output voltages
1. voltage converters can be very efficient for a reasonable cost
1. the newest USB cable standard allows for 100W of power (20V, 5A)
1. many laptops use less than 100W of power to charge
