Batteries and electrical cables in our modern world have become problematic.

# Laptops
My friend's laptop power-brick / charging-cable broke recently, and he had
a hassle trying to find a new one.
The first hurdle, is to find a power source of the correct voltage.
Too low, and the device won't turn on, and may get damaged.
Too high, and the device will *definitely* get damaged.
After that, you need to worry about the physical connector.
Replacement "generic" laptop power adapters have half a dozen or more
connectors of different sizes, shapes, and pin layouts.

# Handheld Power Tools
My weed-whacker's battery is completely different from my brother's.
The batteries for my mother's hand-drill are a different voltage,
size, and shape, than every single brand offered in the local Canadian Tire,
Lowes, and Home Hardware.
It's a good thing it's still holding some charge.
When it completely dies, she'll need to throw the entire drill out.

# Why Care?
