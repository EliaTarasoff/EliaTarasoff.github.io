Batteries and electrical cables in our modern world have become problematic.

# Laptops
My friend's laptop power-brick / charging-cable broke recently, and he had
a hassle trying to find a new one.
The first hurdle, is to find a power source of the correct voltage.
Too low, and the device won't turn on, and may get damaged.
Too high, and the device will *definitely* get damaged.
After that, you need to worry about the physical connector.
Replacement "generic" laptop power adapters have half a dozen or more
connectors of different sizes, shapes, and pin layouts.

# Handheld Power Tools
My weed-whacker's battery is completely different from my brother's.
The batteries for my mother's hand-drill are a different voltage,
size, and shape, than every single brand offered in the local Canadian Tire,
Lowes, and Home Hardware.
If the battery dies dies, she'll need to throw the entire drill out.

# We've Done It Before
We've solved these problems before.

Before the standardization of battery sizes like the D, C, AA, and AAA,
batteries came in just as many sizes as modern larger-sized ones.
Those standard sizes have powered many different devices over the years,
such as portable music players, cameras, remote-controls for televisions
(you know, the device you watch Netflix on nowadays), and walkie-talkies.
Those batteries were so prolific and easy to use, that the wireless keyboard
I'm using to write this *literally has AAs inside of it, instead of a custom
battery*.

Cell-phone charging cables likewise used to be a mess.
Just like laptop power-bricks / cables today, they had different voltages,
maximum amperages, and plug shapes.
New phones couldn't use old cables, and you couldn't borrow one from a friend
if it was a different brand.
A lot of these ended up in the garbage.
However, enough people in Europe got sick of this annoyance and waste,
that they started a campaign on Facebook to spread the word, and
rally people to contact their political representatives.
Because of their work, cell phones must now use standard USB cables to charge.
