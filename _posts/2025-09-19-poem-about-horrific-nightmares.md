In the spring of 2024, I had horrific nightmares for three days in a row.
Nobody noticed that I was delirious from lack of sleep,
when I sent some nonsense direct-messages to someone that I'd never met before.
I ended up in a  stress spiral, with a year and a half of treatment.
Guess which type of social group, and why I'd just read about this Lady. :|

## The Poem
**Don't Fuck With The Lady of Pain**
```
A fairly normal day, ending a fairly normal way.
You awaken in a dark labyrinth.
Friends pass you by in both directions.
You ask for help and they say, "We're saving ourselves!"
A shuffling sound sneaks up behind you.
You're eaten by demon hounds,
Chewed to death in agony.

You awaken again in the labyrinth,
This time alone, and even darker.
A groove in the wall seems like something to follow.
In it, a red pulse of light flows in one direction.
You reach the center and open a hatch.
The Lady of Pain slashes you in half.

Once again in the labyrinth,
But gravity's upside-down.
You're on the ceiling, your friends on the floor.
You finally manage to find an exit.
...And float off into outer space.

Suffocated, you can finally die.
Peace is better than endless pain.
But the Lady says otherwise.
You burn up in atmosphere, landing as a skeleton.
Helpless but to watch entire empires go by -
Happiness, sadness, grief, war -
You alone for evermore.

Eventually your bones disintegrate.
Blackness finally takes you,
But what is void except a clean slate?
The nothingness fluctuates,
Like a heartbeat or pure chaos.

Count from zero to one,
Then through set theory,
Up until infinite infinites.
Countless worlds and universes,
With countless other yous,
Primed and ready to suffer.

You thought reverse gravity was tough?
Try leftward non-gravity.
Try 2D gravity, 5D time, and 6D space.
Uncountably many yous, all out of place.
Tumbling and tossed countlessly endless ways.

That must be it - your one chance of escape.
Countless yous and countless worlds,
Means surely at least one of you is a god.
They hear your call and gently act,
And place you down somewhat intact.
You thank them profusely and prostrate.
...But the Lady bursts out.
Out of their chest to swallow you whole.

Another you tries to invent instead,
Ships, portals and time-machines.
All prototypes fail or explode.
All but one.
You finally end up in a safe place.
Good enough.
You'll build a new life from scratch.
Paying for coffee, the waitress is nice.
Until she turns into the Lady.
Dead again.

Now you're a worm eating dirt.
You'll hapilly get used to eating shit,
But the Lady shows up again.
You can't be allowed happiness.
```
