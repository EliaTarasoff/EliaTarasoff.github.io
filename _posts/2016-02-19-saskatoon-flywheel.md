OK!
Let's say you wanted to supply your city's electricity entirely with renewable energy sources.
Let us further suppose, that you don't want the lights to go out or dim, when the wind stops blowing, or if it's cloudy outside.
You're going to need some kind of storage device, to compensate for the variation in power supply.

This is actually a [very large problem](http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/09/got-storage-how-hard-can-it-be/) no matter what type of storage you choose.
I like flywheels, since they're relatively simple to calculate, and could be built with a wide variety of trade-offs between cost of materials, size, and mass.
For my own city, [Saskatoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon), I worked out the math very roughly a couple of years ago.
This city of about 250k people, would need a flywheel about the size of an office building downtown, to cover its energy needs for a couple days.
That was just the size and mass of filling it with rocks / dirt to get the mass.
It would then need some very large, expensive bearings.
Since having a partial or full vacuum on that size would be crazy-expensive, you'd be losing a lot of energy per day.

Not good.
Let's do better.

(finish writing this up...)
